# Applied-Machine-Learning-Course-Projects
Fall 2021, I was honored to attend a machine learning course in the presence of Dr. Haji AbolHassan. We gave three projects for our group for this lesson, two of which were in my possession. In this repository, you can see the code and report of these two projects.

The code is executed on my personal computer and on a computing server. For this reason, source codes have not been prepared for these projects. Anyway, I put the sweeping conclusions and source codes on the PDFs. For this purpose, the code doesn't need to exist. Furthermore, the codes are included in the report as short as possible.

I consulted with friends that I would like to name during the project.

-**Ehsan Hosseinzadeh** Ph.D. student at SFU University.

-**Behrad TaghiBeilgLoo** Ph.D. Student, University of Toronto.

-**Sohrab Faridi**, official TA of the course and graduate of Shahid Beheshti University.

-**Kian Adib** Master student of Shahid Beheshti University.

*I also thank Arazcloud for providing me with its powerful computing servers at special discounts. (Both internal computing server and Linux VPS server to connect to websites such as overleaf)*

# Applied-Machine-Learning-Course-Projects
Fall 2021, I was honored to attend a machine learning course in the presence of Dr. Haji AbolHassan. We gave three projects for our group for this lesson, two of which were in my possession. In this repository, you can see the code and report of these one project.
